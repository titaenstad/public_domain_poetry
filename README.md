# Public domain poetry
Some Norwegian poetry that is in the public domain.

These books are all from [this](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/ressurskatalog/oai-nb-no-sbr-34/) corpus (made by running OCR on book scans). 
By personal request, Spr√•kbanken agreed to run re-OCR on these books, so the text quality should be a little bit better than in the source corpus (as of Feb 2022)

The books are split into pre-1900 (books published before 1900) and post-1900 (books published on or after 1900). 're-ocr_info.tsv' contains information about the books. 

Because the books were selected by regex on book title, some books may not contain poetry.
